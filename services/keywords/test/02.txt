<div>  <p>Thatgamecompany is a studio best known for poetic, emotional adventures like <em>Flower </em>and <em>Journey</em> — and now the team is bringing its next release to Apple TV. Creative lead and studio CEO Jenova Chen was onstage today at Apple’s latest keynote to show off <em>Sky</em>, billed as a “romantic adventure game.” It looks in keeping with the studio’s past work, with lush environments to explore and comparatively minimalist game elements. It’s also is being designed with the Apple TV in mind. “Everything can be done with one finger on the Siri remote,” Chen says of the game.</p><p>In <a href="http://thatgamecompany.com/first-details-announced-next-game-sky/">a blog post on the studio’s site</a>, thatgamecompany provided a bit more detail on just what <em>Sky </em>will be like.</p><blockquote><p><em>Sky</em> has been a few years in the making.  After the release of <em>Journey,</em> so many fans wrote to tell us how much they enjoyed playing the game with their spouse, children, or loved ones, and asked if we could create a game where they could play together. We wanted as many people to love games, and so we were encouraged to explore this idea at thatgamecompany.  Which brings our games, for the first time, to mobile — a platform that many have access to, the world over.  </p><p>It’s hard to explain the game, but a good place would be to say that <em>Sky</em> is a game specially created to be played, and shared, among loved ones and family.  If you can imagine the delight of visiting a theme park where lasting memories are made, we envision <em>Sky</em> will sometimes feel like that.</p></blockquote><p><em>Sky</em> will be coming to both the iPhone and iPad, and is expected to launch this winter. iPhone X is good</p></div>
